classdef oppDictionary < oppSpot
    %OPPDICTIONARY  Dictionary of concatenated operators that acts in
    %               parallel
    %
    %   D = oppDictionary([WEIGHTS],OP1,OP2,...OPn,GATHER) creates a
    %   dictionary operator consisting of the concatenation of all
    %   operators. Each of the operators is multiplied with the
    %   corresponding part of x on seperate labs.
    %
    %   D = oppDictionary(N,OP) creates a stacked operator A using N number
    %   of repeating operators OP.
    %
    %   GATHER specifies whether to gather the results to a local array
    %   or leave them distributed, default is 0.
    %   GATHER = 0 will leave them distributed.
    %   GATHER = 1 will gather the results
    %
    %   Optional WEIGHTS vector:
    %
    %               [WEIGHT1*OP1
    %                WEIGHT2*OP2
    %                   ...
    %                WEIGHTn*OPn]
    %
    %   If the same weight is to be applied to each operator, set
    %   WEIGHTS to a scalar. When WEIGHTS is empty [], it is set to
    %   one. The WEIGHT parameter can be omitted as long as OP1 is a
    %   Spot operator; if not there is no way to
    %   decide whether it is a weight vector or operator.
    %
    %   *Note - only spot operators can be used in an oppDictionary, pSpot
    %   operators act in parallel already, and cannot be used with
    %   oppDictionary.
    %
    %   **Note - As of now the operators will be distributed according to
    %   the Matlab default codistribution scheme. The x vector should be
    %   distributed with this in mind.
    %   for more info, type 'help codistributor1d'
