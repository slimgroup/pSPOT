classdef opdWindowLast1HaloAverage < oppSpot
%opdWindowLast1HaloAverage tapered windowing for CARP-CG method
%
%   opdWindowLast1HaloAverage(N,L,P,H)
%
%   ARGUMENTS:
%      N = length of the input vector
%      L = length of the last dimension of input vector
%      P = number of processors
%      H = half of the overlap's size
%
%   ATTRIBUTES:
%      xshape = (p,3) vector holding start, size, end indecies
%           of the default distribution of the input vector in every window
%      yshape = (p,3) vector holding start, size, end indecies
%           of the default distribution of the output vector in every window
%
%   Notes:
%       1. This is a parallel/distributed operator
%       2. This operator does not pass dottest
