classdef oppKron2Lo < oppSpot
    %oppKron2Lo  kronecker tensor product to act on a distributed vector.
    %
    %   oppKron2Lo(A,B, gather)A and B are Spot operators or numeric 
    %   matrices. Optional param gather specifies whether the output vector
    %   should be gathered to local lab.
    %   GATHER = 0 will not gather
    %   GATHER = 1 will gather the results of forwards or adjoint
    %   multiplication.
    %   GATHER = 2 will gather only in forward mode.
    %   GATHER = 3 will gather only in backwards (adjoint) mode.
    %
    %       %% Example: Defining seperable sparsity transforms over 
    %       different axes. Here we define a sparsity transform S that 
    %       performs Wavelet analysis on the first dimension
    %       and a 2D Curvelet analysis on the second & third dimension
    %             dim=[64,32,32];
    %             C = opCurvelet(dim(2),dim(3));
    %             W = opWavelet(dim(1),1);
    %             S = oppKron2Lo(C,W,1);
    %
    %       % Make a random 3d data-array
    %       D = distributed.randn(dim(1),prod(dim(2:end)));
    %
    %       % Check to see if the analysis followed by synthesis returns 
    %       the original signal
    %       norm(D(:)-S'*S*D(:))
    %
    %   note that the second operator is applied to x and then the first
    %   operator to the transpose of the result, and so x should be of
    %   dimemsions [cols(op2),cols(op1)], and vectorized after distribution
    %   so it is distributed along the columns evenly.
    %
    %   *Now oppKron2Lo also supports local x vectors and distributes them
    %   before calculation( this distribution will be faster than using 
    %   matlabs (:) function).
