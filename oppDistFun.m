    %   Q = oppDistFun(A1,A2,...,AN,F,GATHER), where A1,A2,...,AN are 
    %   distributed arrays and F is a function handle that takes in local 
    %   parts of A1,A2,...,AN and gives a local part of the final answer. 
    %   The arguments of F has to be standardized as: 
    %   y = F(a1,a2,...,an,x,mode), where a1,a2,...,an corresponds to
    %   the local parts of A1,A2,...,AN, and x is the distributed vector 
    %   that the operator is applied on.
    %   mode = 1 defines the forward mode
    %   mode = 2 defines the adjoint mode
    %   mode = 0 will return the sizes, complexity and linearity in an
    %   array in the following format: [m n cflag linflag]
    %   m and n has to be the conceptual size of Q so that the
    %   multiplication sizes would match.
    %   cflag is the complexity of this operator.
    %   linflag is the linearity of this operator.
    %
    %   GATHER specifies whether to gather the results to a local array
    %   or leave them distributed, default is 0.
    %   GATHER = 0 will leave them distributed.
    %   GATHER = 1 will gather the results of forwards or adjoint 
    %            multiplication.
    %   GATHER = 2 will gather only in forward mode.
    %   GATHER = 3 will gather only in backward (adjoint) mode.
    %
    %   Use case to keep in mind:
    %   (Ax - s)
    %
    %     A = length m x n
    %     s = length n
    % 
    %     P <---- constructs like oppFunComposite({A,s},F)
    % 
    %     F <-- function  y = functionF(A, B, x, mode)
    %            if mode==1
    %            y = A * x - B;
    %            elseif mode==2
    %            y = A' * x - conj(B);
    %            elseif mode=='0'
    %            retrun {m, n}
    %          end
