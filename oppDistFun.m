classdef oppDistFun < oppSpot
    %OPPDISTFUN     Fun(ction) evaluation over slices of distributed arrays
    %
    %   Q = oppDistFun(A1,A2,...,AN,F,GATHER), where A1,A2,...,AN are 
    %   distributed arrays and F is a function handle that takes in local 
    %   parts of A1,A2,...,AN and gives a local part of the final answer. 
    %   The arguments of F has to be standardized as: 
    %   y = F(a1,a2,...,an,x,mode), where a1,a2,...,an corresponds to
    %   the local parts of A1,A2,...,AN, and x is the distributed vector 
    %   that the operator is applied on.
    %   mode = 1 defines the forward mode
    %   mode = 2 defines the adjoint mode
    %   mode = 0 will return the sizes, complexity and linearity in an
    %   array in the following format: [m n cflag linflag]
    %   m and n has to be the conceptual size of Q so that the
    %   multiplication sizes would match.
    %   cflag is the complexity of this operator.
    %   linflag is the linearity of this operator.
    %
    %   GATHER specifies whether to gather the results to a local array
    %   or leave them distributed, default is 0.
    %   GATHER = 0 will leave them distributed.
    %   GATHER = 1 will gather the results of forwards or adjoint 
    %            multiplication.
    %   GATHER = 2 will gather only in forward mode.
    %   GATHER = 3 will gather only in backward (adjoint) mode.
    %   
    %   ## Example use case:
    %   
    %   Computing expression over distributed index k
    %     y_k = (A_k * x_k - s_k)
    %   where
    %     A = size m by n by k
    %     x = size n by k
    %     s = size k
    %     (A, x, s are all distributed over the last dimension where size=k)
    % 
    %   We write a custom function F that performs (Ax-s) for each k
    %     F <-- function y = F(A, B, x, mode)
    %               if mode==1
    %               y = A * x - B;
    %               elseif mode==2
    %               y = A' * x - conj(B);
    %               elseif mode=='0'
    %               retrun {m, n}
    %           end
    % 
    %     P <---- constructed with `oppDistFun({A,s},F)`
    % 
    %     Then y = P*x will perform:
    % 
    %     for each A(:,k), s(k), k = 1:n (distributed)
    %        y(k) = F(A(:,k),s(k),x(k),1)
    %     end
