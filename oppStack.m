classdef oppStack < oppSpot
    %OPPSTACK  Stack of vertically concatenated operators in parallel
    %
    %   S = oppStack([WEIGHTS], OP1, OP2, ...OPn,GATHER) creates a stacked 
    %   operator A consisting of the vertical concatenation of all 
    %   operators. When applied the operators are divided amongst the labs 
    %   and applied locally on each lab.
    %
    %   S = oppStack(N,OP) creates a stacked operator A using N number of
    %   repeating operators OP.
    %
    %   GATHER specifies whether to gather the results to a local array
    %   or leave them distributed, default is 0.
    %   GATHER = 0 will leave them distributed.
    %   GATHER = 1 will gather the results.
    %
    %   Optional WEIGHTS vector:
    %
    %               [WEIGHT1*OP1
    %                WEIGHT2*OP2
    %                   ...
    %                WEIGHTn*OPn]
    %
    %   If the same weight is to be applied to each operator, set
    %   WEIGHTS to a scalar. When WEIGHTS is empty [], it is set to
    %   one. The WEIGHT parameter can be omitted as long as OP1 is a
    %   Spot operator; if not there is no way to
    %   decide whether it is a weight vector or operator.
    %
    %   *Note - only spot operators can be used in an oppStack, pSpot
    %   operators act in parallel already, and cannot be used with
    %   oppDictionary.
    %
    %   **Note - As of now the operators will be distributed according to
    %   the Matlab default codistribution scheme.
